### Translations
I only know English so definately need help with this. I also don't know heaps about javascript multilingual stuff but thanks to @mizaki we have a structure ready to go. so it should be nice and easy to translate the UI.

At time of writing there is 3 languages (english,french,german) more can be easily added.  

To contribute, send me a PR on a new branch, or if you don't know git, a link to the language file.

Language Files [here](https://github.com/jez500/chorus2/tree/master/src/lang). English is the only real complete translation file
